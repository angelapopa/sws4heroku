Topic: Hotel Booking Web API (Hydra)

Version: 2.0

Level: Assignment 7

### Introduction

Our assignment was to implement a Hotel Booking Web API
and to annotate it with hydra classes, which in turn describe our Web API.

Our application source code for this assignment is available also at

https://github.com/angelapopa/sws4heroku.git.

Currently it is split into 2 parts, a server and a client.

## The Server

Our server was implemented with NodeJS and is currently available on heroku.
e.g.

https://afternoon-meadow-35531.herokuapp.com/api/hotels/5aeb56f1eb089a6227c8fcf4/

The Server is a continuation of Assignemt 4, where we implement a REST API for booking hotel rooms. All Available endpoints are listed at the end of this document.

For this last assignment we extended our server with `hydra` and `schema.org` annotation to create the documentation for our Web API.

We annotated our already existing plain json data with `schema.org` annotations, mainly using `@type`, `@id`, `@context`.

We created a `vocab` file for the documentation our our WEb API using `hydra` classes.

https://github.com/angelapopa/sws4heroku/blob/master/api/vocab.json

Currently following hydra classes are annotated `Hotel`, `Booking`, `Price`, `Offer`, `HotelCollection`, `Endpoint`.

After switching to heroku and using explicit links in the hydra vocab file, our web api documentation was displayed correctly in the hydra console. (Relative urls as we tried one week before, were not working).

```
{
    "@id": "https://afternoon-meadow-35531.herokuapp.com/api/vocab",
    "@type": "ApiDocumentation",
    "@context": {
        "vocab": "https://afternoon-meadow-35531.herokuapp.com/api/vocab#",
        "hydra": "http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/core#",
        "ApiDocumentation": "hydra:ApiDocumentation",
        "property": {
            "@id": "hydra:property",
            "@type": "@id"
        },
        ......
```

Currently this are displayable by the Hydra Console

https://www.markus-lanthaler.com/hydra/console/

for example with urls:

* https://afternoon-meadow-35531.herokuapp.com/api/hotels/5aeb56f1eb089a6227c8fcf4/

* https://afternoon-meadow-35531.herokuapp.com/api/hotels/5aeb56f1eb089a6227c8fcf4/rooms

* https://afternoon-meadow-35531.herokuapp.com/api/hotels/5aeb56f1eb089a6227c8fcf4/rooms/Doppelzimmer,%20Dusche,%20WC,%20ruhig/prices

On the right hand side the hydra annotated web api documentation is listed.

As a side note, the right hand site is not updated for each request, instead all avalable hydra classes are listed in the dropdown next to the word `Documentation`.

Some other hotel IDs that can be used for testing might be:

`5aeb56f1eb089a6227c8fcf8`
`5aeb56f1eb089a6227c8fd0a`
`5aeb56f1eb089a6227c8fd0a`

#### Future work for the server side
Annotate remaining endpoints with hydra classes.
Annotate paginagion with hydra for the list of hotels.
Annotate remaining endpoints data with schema.org annotations.

## The Generic Client

Our client was implemented in .NET and is testable by starting the executable
`RestClientEnd.exe` located at

`https://github.com/angelapopa/sws4heroku/tree/master/RestClient/`.

Prerequisites: a running Windows instance and cloning the source code.
No other software/tools are needed to be installed.

#### What the client does?

* Implemeting Http request by Rest Client, not hydra vocab till now.

## Endpoints

### Enpoints currently working in the hydra console
`/api/hotels/5aeb56f1eb089a6227c8fcf4/`

`/api/hotels/5aeb56f1eb089a6227c8fcf4/rooms`

`/api/hotels/5aeb56f1eb089a6227c8fcf4/rooms/Doppelzimmer,%20Dusche,%20WC,%20ruhig/prices`

### Enpoints/Resources implemented for Assignment 4

Currently not all are annotated with hydra for assignment 7.
